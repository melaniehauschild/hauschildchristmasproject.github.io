                    <p style=text-align:justify>To tell you that I have made some very good friends here, people I can relate to and people that make me genuinely happy. </p>
                    <p style=text-align:justify> I know that you were always worried about me getting along with people in this new environment. I didn't have that many friends in high school, not because of not being able to make friends but because I chose them carefully. Suprisingly, I have found close friends who have the same unhealthy obsession with skincare products like I do. I must admit, the people here are different as compared to our peaceful province. But they make me laugh until I'm teary-eyed and they make me smile from ear to ear. </p>
                    <p>Here they are:</p>

                        This is Jewel, Josh, and I at a party. The party you were so excited to hear about after you specifically said, "Puro kayo aral diyan sa La Salle! Wala bang party diyan?"
