                    <p style=text-align:justify>To tell you that I am extremely grateful for all that you do for me.</p>
                    <p style=text-align:justify>I never thought I would be able to study in such a prestigious (and expensive) university like this. Thank you for guiding me into this career path, when I was clueless of what I wanted to do. I am happy to say that you didn't force me to study a course that I didn't want to because you two aren't like many parents I know. I appreciate all the efforts you make to ensure I have a good place to stay in during my university journey, enough food in the freezer to last me weeks, and constant support and encouragement even when my classes are proving to be challenging. I will never get tired of saying thank you because you two are my world and you were there for me when no one else was. </p>
